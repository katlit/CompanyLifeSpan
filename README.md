This is a group university project where we analyzed the statistical aspects of company dissolution in Denmark.

My contributions focused on survival analysis and hazard models, which I implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python to analyze company lifespans.

You can find my analysis in the Jupyter Notebook, and the full report is available as a PDF.
